# ParkingLot


I learn about dependency injection...

how attendent class parking vehicle accordingly.

declare :  ParkingStrategy parkingStrategy;       and initialise in constructor.    (is called dependency injection)

then Attendent used that strategy to implement while parking . (So the method park() is invoked of perticular strategy like
ParkingLotWithMaximumCapacity,ParkingLotWithMaximumFreeSpace accordingly)
